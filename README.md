Monthly Tech and Morale Adjustment

***SUMMARY***

After a lot of playing it became clear that choosing the Spartan funding level for -4 morale was highly irrelevant and felt like an exploit. This mod addresses that issue in two ways:

It increases the morale malus/boost from choosing funding levels. This is set at -10/-5/0/+5/+10. This change is temporary and lasts until the next financial report.
There is now an associated MechTech and MedTech penalty to the funding level as well. This is set at -2/-1/0/+1/+2. This change is also temporary and lasts until the next financial report.

It gets a little bit more painful to short your company their money, and now you can pay for a boost in MechTech/MedTech Skill when you really need it!

***ADJUSTABLE SETTINGS***

AdjustTechs: true (set to false to only have it change morale)
MechTechScale: 1; (Change the scaling of MechTech. This is to have functionality with other mods. Vanilla: 1)


***KNOWN ISSUES***

Partial save game compatibility. If you want to add this mod to your saved game, make sure your financial level is current set at "Normal" with a +0 bonus.

***INSTALLATION NOTES***

Unzip the folder and add it to your BATTLETECH\mods folder.

Make sure you have BMTL and ModTek installed.
